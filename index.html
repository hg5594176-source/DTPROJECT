      <h2>MORE ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>
         <strong></strong> 
         <p>I am a dedicated Computer Science and Data Science student at KIET, driven by a passion for technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning. I enjoy exploring how data and innovation can come together to build smarter, more impactful solutions, and I’m always looking for opportunities to challenge myself and grow.

Outside academics, I actively play football for FCKIET, where I’ve learned the true value of teamwork, discipline, and resilience. Being on the field has shaped my ability to stay focused under pressure and adapt quickly to changing situations.

I am also a part of the Spark Fashion Society, which allows me to express my creative side through fashion events and modeling. It’s a space where I balance my technical mindset with creativity, confidence, and presentation skills.

As an athlete, I constantly push myself to stay fit, improve my performance, and maintain a strong sense of discipline in everything I do. Managing academics, sports, and creative pursuits has helped me develop strong time-management skills and a balanced approach to life.

Overall, I see myself as a versatile individual—technically curious, creatively expressive, and athletically driven—always ready to take on new challenges and grow in every direction.</p>
